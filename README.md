# Static Webpack

A basic Webpack configuration to create simple static sites with Handlebars (or HTML or Pug) and SCSS.

## Usage

#### Clone

```
git clone https://github.com/sntiagomoreno/static-webpack.git static-site
```

#### Remove Git

Get into your project folder:

```
cd static-site
```

Remove this repo versioning files

```
rm -rf .git
```

### Install Dependencies

```
yarn install
```

### Pages Settings

All static pages are generated by the [html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin). You can edit your page settings `config/pages.config.js` to match your requirements.

#### Options

-   `extension //hbs, pug/jade or html` Default `hbs`.
-   `inject //false, head or body` Default `body`.
-   `pages //Array of page objects` `title` and `filename` are required.

### For Development

This enables webpack-dev-server for Hot Module Replacement. It also uses browser-sync for a quick way of accessing your site from an external IP. [See more browser-sync options](https://browsersync.io/docs/options).

```
yarn dev
```

### For Production

```
yarn build
```
